# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

#Deploy   

```bash
gitpod /workspace/Multiplayer-NFT-Card-Game/backend-web3 (main) $ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network fuji
